Dissent.in
==========
Python script for tracking worldwide dissent through the twitter live stream. Very early in development, could use some help. Eventually I want to the program to be able to make relatively accurate predictions of future acts of dissent, and at least provide the public a place to track worldwide dissent.


Quickstart
==========

Twython is required https://github.com/ryanmcgrath/twython

See the twython page if you need help getting it set up, its pretty straight forward though. You will also need API access with twitter, again, see the twython page for details setting this up.

run <code>python dissent.py</code> in terminal. It will create a database called tweets.db in the same directory as dissent.py  

view contents of the database by running <code>tweets.py tweets.db</code>. This will list the contents of the database and some very basic reporting. 

I need help
===========
I'm completely new to python, I am learning. Show me how to do things properly. Thanks!
