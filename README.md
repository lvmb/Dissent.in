Dissent.in
==========

Python script for tracking worldwide dissent through the twitter live stream. Very early in development, could use some help. Eventually I want to the program to be able to make relatively accurate predictions of future acts of dissent, and at least provide the public a place to track worldwide dissent.




Quickstart
==========
easy_install twython

add your twitter auth details 

run python dissent.py in terminal 

view contents of the database by running tweets.py


I need help
===========
I'm completely new to python, I am learning. Show me how to do things properly. Thanks!
