Dissent.in
==========

The humble beginnings of something big?

This python script intends to scan, track, and analyze in near real time - levels of dissent and political upheval around the globe - using the twitter live stream. 

As we have seen numerous times over, twitter has played an enourmous part in numerous world-wide acts of dissent and discord. Dissent.in ultimately would like to use it real time twitter stream to analyze, predict, and alert. Hopefully before mass discord. 

This is very early in development, I am completely new to python, and I could use some help. If you are a scientist, programmer, engineer, or just someone who thinks it is a neat idea, please contribute!


Quickstart
==========

Twython is required https://github.com/ryanmcgrath/twython

See the twython page if you need help getting it set up, its pretty straight forward though. You will also need API access with twitter, again, see the twython page for details setting this up.

run <code>python dissent.py</code> in terminal. It will create a database called tweets.db in the same directory as dissent.py  

view contents of the database by running <code>tweets.py tweets.db</code>. This will list the contents of the database and some very basic reporting. 

I need help
===========
I'm completely new to python, I am learning. Show me how to do things properly. Thanks!
